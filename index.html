            Stacks of books on shelves and tables. A telescope against a glass wall. And dry-erase boards, marked with foreign
            languages. Different colors for different dialects.

            Mingled here are also dinner plates. Candlelight.
            <br><br>
            She pauses when a deck light winks on outside. Her eyes
            sparkle when she sees something:
            <br><br>
            A question, written on the glass, lit from outdoors.
            <br>
            "Do you want to make a baby?"

                    Louise cradles a NEWBORN GIRL in her arms. Her name: HANNAH.

                    Hannah reaches up.
                    <br>
                    Crooks her tiny hand around Louise's finger.
                    <br><br>
                    LATER
                    <br><br>    
                    A NURSE starts to take baby Hannah to give Louise some rest.
                    <br>
                    Hannah BLEATS and reaches for her mother.
                    <br><br>
                    Louise smiles through the exhaustion and pulls her back--

                    Four year old HANNAH dressed as a cowgirl.
                    <br>
                    On a toy riding horse with wheels for hooves.
                    <br>
                    Giggling like she can't stop.
                    <br><br>
                    She pulls both finger-guns, aimed at us.

                    Eight-year-old Hannah is tucked in bed.

                    --and storms into her room.

            Twelve-year-old daughter HANNAH lies, eyes closed.
            <br><br>
            Hannah is pale. Her head has been shaved in the last month.
            <br><br>
            Louise holds her daughter's hand in hers.
            <br>   
            Her thumb traces Hannah's knuckles.
            <br><br>
            A life monitor beeps as Hannah's heart stops.
            <br><br>
            Hannah's eyes roll up and she sighs her final breath.
            <br><br>
            Louise's grip on her daughter tightens. Trembling.
            <br><br>
            A Nurse starts to pull Louise away, but she hangs on-- now
            <br>
            it's mother trying to return to her baby girl--
            <br><br>
            Louise is unaware she's crying. Hannah remains motionless.
